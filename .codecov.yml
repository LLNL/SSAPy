# Inline codecov annotations make the code hard to read, and they add
# annotations in files that seemingly have nothing to do with the PR.

# Attempt to fix "Missing base commit" messages in the codecov UI.
# Because we do not run full tests on package PRs, package PRs' merge
# commits on `main` don't have coverage info.  It appears that
# codecov will give you an error if the pseudo-base's coverage data
# doesn't all apply properly to the real PR base.
