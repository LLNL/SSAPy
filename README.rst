SSAPy is a python package allowing for fast and precise orbital modeling.

SSAPy is much faster than other orbit modeling tools and offers:

- A variety of integrators, including Runge-Kutta, SciPy, SGP4, etc.
- Customizable force propagation models, including a variety of Earth gravity models, lunar gravity, radiation pressure, etc.
- Multiple-hypothesis tracking (MHT) UCT linker
- Vectorized computations
- Short arc probabilistic orbit determination
- Conjunction probability estimation
- Uncertainty quantification
- Monte Carlo data fusion
- Support for multiple coordinate frames (with coordinate frame conversions)

Installation
------------

For installation details, see the `Installing SSAPy <https://LLNL.github.io/SSAPy/installation.html>`_ section of the documentation.

Strict dependencies
-------------------

- `Python <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/>`_ (3.8+)

The following are installed automatically when you install SSAPy:

- `numpy <https://scipy.org/install.html>`_;
- `scipy <https://scipy.org/scipylib/index.html>`_ for many statistical functions;
- `astropy <https://www.astropy.org/>`_ for astronomy related functions;
- `pyerfa <https://pypi.org/project/pyerfa/>`_ a Python wrapper for the ERFA library;
- `emcee <https://pypi.org/project/emcee/>`_ an affine-invariant ensemble sampler for Markov chain Monte Carlo;
- `lmfit <https://pypi.org/project/lmfit/>`_ a package for non-linear least-squares minimization and curve fitting;
- `sgp4 <https://pypi.org/project/sgp4/>`_ contains functions to compute the positions of satellites in Earth orbit;
- `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ as a plotting backend;
- and other utility packages, as enumerated in `setup.py`.

Documentation
-------------

All documentation is hosted at `https://LLNL.github.io/SSAPy/ <https://LLNL.github.io/SSAPy/>`_.

The API documentation may also be seen by doing:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3
    >>> import ssapy
    >>> help(ssapy)

Contributing
------------

Contributing to SSAPy is relatively easy. Just send us a `pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/>`_. When you send your request, make `main` the destination branch on the `SSAPy repository <https://github.com/LLNL/SSAPy>`_.

Your PR must pass SSAPy's unit tests and documentation tests, and must be `PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ compliant. We enforce these guidelines with our CI process. To run these tests locally, and for helpful tips on git, see our `Contribution Guide <https://ssapy.reathedocs.io/en/latest/contribution_guide.html>`_.

SSAPy's `main` branch has the latest contributions. Pull requests should target `main`, and users who want the latest package versions, features, etc. can use `main`.

Releases
--------

For multi-user site deployments or other use cases that need very stable software installations, we recommend using SSAPy's `stable releases <https://github.com/LLNL/SSAPy/releases>`_.

Each SSAPy release series also has a corresponding branch, e.g. `releases/v0.14` has `0.14.x` versions of SSAPy, and `releases/v0.13` has `0.13.x` versions. We backport important bug fixes to these branches but we do not advance the package versions or make other changes that would change the way SSAPy concretizes dependencies within a release branch. So, you can base your SSAPy deployment on a release branch and `git pull` to get fixes, without the package churn that comes with `main`.

The latest release is always available with the `releases/latest` tag.

See the `docs on releases <https://ssapy.reathedocs.io/en/latest/contribution_guide.html#releases>`_ for more details.
